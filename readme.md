Tech Jam3 Would Like To Have
============================

* [Modules/Libraries](modules.md)
* [Tools](tools.md)

The purpose of this repo is to document and discuss libraries, modules, and tools we'd like to have at Jam3. It's sort of a hit list of stuff to work on when we have free time.

To lower the barrier of entry new ideas can be added as issues when there's enough interest the idea will be moved to the .md files.
