Tech Jam3 Would Like To Have
============================

* [Modules/Libraries](modules.md)
* [Tools](tools.md)

The purpose of this repo is to document and discuss libraries, modules, and tools we'd like to have at Jam3. It's sort of a hit list of stuff to work on when we have free time.

## Contributing

To lower the barrier of entry new ideas can be added as issues. Issues will be moved to their respective `.md` files when the issue has enough nominations.

### Documenting ideas through issues

The title of issues should be entered in the following format:
`[Category]: [Short Description]`

For example:

`Module: String Sanitizer`

Descriptions of issues should describe the purpose of the new technology and an estimate of how long it might take to build.

For example:
```
Dev time: 2 days

This module would be a function which would accept two strings. One string being the string that should be sanitized and the other being string to be removed.
```

### Nominating issues

After an issue has been created it can be discussed and nominated on.

Discussion should be constructive! Nominations will be entered via the :thumbsup: (`:thumbsup:` or `:+1:`) emoji.

For example positive feedback with nomination:
`I think a function to sanitize strings would be great` :thumbsup:

Negative feedback:
`I'm not sure a string sanitization function can be built in 2 days. Maybe 3 would be better.`

### Moving Nominated Issues To .md

Once an issue has at least 2 nominations it will be moved to their respective markdown file determined by the category in the issue title.

For instance:
`Module: String Sanitizer` would be moved to `modules.md`

In `modules.md` it would look like this:

```
### String Sanitizer

Dev Time: 3 days

This module would be a function which would accept two strings. One string being the string 
that should be sanitized and the other being string to be removed.
```
