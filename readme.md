Tech Jam3 Would Like To Have
============================

* [Modules/Libraries](modules.md)
* [Tools](tools.md)

The purpose of this repo is to document and discuss libraries, modules, and tools we'd like to have at Jam3. It's sort of a hit list of stuff to work on when we have free time.

## Contributing

To lower the barrier of entry new ideas will be added as issues to this repo. Issues will be moved to their respective `.md` files when the issue has enough nominations.

### Documenting ideas through issues

The title of issues should be entered in the following format:

`[Category]: [Short Description]`

For example:

`Module: String Sanitizer`

Descriptions of issues should describe the purpose of the new technology and an estimate of how long it might take to build.

For example:
```
Dev Time: 2 days

This module would be a function which would accept two strings. One string being the string 
that should be sanitized and the other being string to be removed.
```

### Discussing and Nominating issues

After an issue has been created it can be discussed and nominated on.

* Discussion should be constructive! 
* In discussion there should be research done if a tech already exists that is similar to what was mentioned
* Nominations will be entered via github issue labels. 

When nominating if you are the first user to nominate add the *nomimantion1* label. For the second nomination which is required to move it to an .md file use the *nomination2* label. All labels can be seen here:

### Moving Nominated Issues To .md

Once an issue has at least 2 nominations it will be moved to their respective markdown file determined by the category in the issue title.

For instance:

`Module: String Sanitizer` would be moved to `modules.md`

Once moved to `modules.md` it would look like this:

```
### String Sanitizer

Dev Time: 3 days

This module would be a function which would accept two strings. One string being the string 
that should be sanitized and the other being string to be removed.
```
